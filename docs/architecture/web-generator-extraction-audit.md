# Web Generator — Extraction Audit (Re-verification)

**Status:** Step-1 domain split EXECUTED (this document updated after the change)  
**Date:** 2026-09-13  
**Branch:** `c21.4-physically-extract-analysis-from-backend`  
**Baseline commit:** `066ddaae` ("arch(orchestration): physically extract orchestration package")  
**Step-1 change:** in-repo `generation-progress` domain module extracted (see §9) — **no package created**  
**Target package:** `@animastor/web-generator`  
**Target location:** `packages/animastor-web-generator/` (NOT created — no physical extraction performed)  
**Re-verification of:** `web-next-extraction-reconnaissance.md` (§3.1, verdict "NOT READY")  
**Context:** Verdict re-checked at current HEAD after the workers (`b096d2a6`) and local-ai (`71065221`) extractions.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Generator contour is **NOT READY** for physical package extraction at current HEAD. The verdict from the previous reconnaissance is **unchanged**, but the risk surface has shifted: the generateStore⇄playbackStore cycle is dissolved, the store has no router or `@animastor/*` dependencies, and API access is a pure transport layer. What remains is the **identity blocker**: `generateStore` is the host-owned source of truth for session identity (`bookId`/`buildId`), written and read by 10+ host files, 3 extracted packages (via adapters), auth stash/restore, and the fileStore session seam.

A **domain-first slice** (analysis/progress pure logic) was READY WITH CONDITIONS at baseline — **Step 1 is now EXECUTED** (§9): the slice physically exists as the in-repo module `state/generationProgress/` with parameterized state, independent unit tests, and a contour guard. It is now **READY for a mechanical package cut** (§10).

**Key findings:**
- **2,553 LOC** core contour (4 files), ~30 signals in one store
- **10 direct production consumers** + fileStore via injected seams
- **No `@animastor/*` imports** — pure host modules today
- **No web-facing generation contracts** in `@animastor/contracts` — wire types would need vendoring (precedent: `animastor-web-player/src/models.ts`)
- Cycle generateStore⇄playbackStore **already dissolved** (guard-pinned in `player-contour.guard.test.ts`)

## 2. File Inventory

### 2.1 Core contour (production — post Step-1 split, see §9)

| File | LOC | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `state/generateStore.ts` | 858 | Generation orchestration host: identity, phase, VBook flow, SSE transport, actions — progress logic delegated to `generationProgress/` |
| `state/generationProgress/` (6 files) | 875 | generation-progress domain slice: analysis state machine, progress rows, SSE routing, timer math — explicit state objects, no host reach |
| `pages/GeneratePage.tsx` | 703 | The Generate screen: worker cards, scope dialog, polls, timer |
| `pages/AnalysisProgressPanel.tsx` | 187 | Per-task parallel-analysis rows (consumed only by GeneratePage) |
| **TOTAL** | **2,623** | |

### 2.2 Core contour (tests — post Step-1 split)

| File | LOC | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `state/generationProgress/analysis.test.ts` | 239 | `applyAnalysisEvent` purity, `analysisOverallPercent`, reset semantics, heartbeat — standalone (no store import) |
| `state/generationProgress/progressRows.test.ts` | 363 | `computeProgressRows`: floor monotonicity, stale-done gate, sibling keys, 10s window, new-gen gate, finalize, VBook rows, reset |
| `state/generationProgress/sseRouting.test.ts` | 125 | SSE routing: analysis/heartbeat/import_complete/generation_complete/malformed |
| `state/generationProgress/timer.test.ts` | 61 | timer start/stop/freeze/restart + formatter |
| `state/generationProgress/vbookProgress.test.ts` | 108 | SSE event mapping + agent-status merge + factories |
| `state/generateStore.analysis.test.ts` | 139 | Host integration: layer-config roundtrip, SSE seam end-to-end, reset wrapper |
| **TOTAL** | **1,035** | |

### 2.3 Combined total

**3,658 LOC** (2,623 production + 1,035 tests, post Step-1 split — was 2,553 at baseline; the growth is the new standalone domain unit tests)

### 2.4 Shared infrastructure the contour depends on (NOT part of the contour — candidate ports)

| File | LOC | What generateStore/GeneratePage use from it |
|---|---|---|
| `api/client.ts` | 250 | `getJson`, `postJson`, `postJsonLong`, `putJson`, `sse` (pure transport; centralized fetch; no window/document reach) |
| `api/models.ts` | 835 | Generation wire types at lines 501–731: `WorkerCounts`, `ProgressPanelResponse`, `AgentStatusResponse`, `LayerConfigResponse`, `BookStatus`, `RegenerateRequest/Response`, `DiffSummary`, `ProgressEvent`, plus `sceneRefs()`/`SceneRef` (460–479), `AssetsStateResponse` |
| `state/positionStore.ts` | 27 | `navigateTo`, `position` (post-generation anchoring) |
| `state/resourceInvalidations.ts` | 69 | `bookResource`, `onResourceInvalidated` (external invalidation reload in GeneratePage) |
| `state/resilientReloader.ts` | 212 | `resilientReload`, `sharedRecovery` (book load backoff 1s→2s→5s→10s) |
| `app/i18n.ts` | 1,780 | `t`, `tf`, `vbookStageLabel` (store uses only `vbookStageLabel`) |
| `app/router.ts` | 20 | `navigate` (GeneratePage only — to `/navigate`, `/settings/vbook`, `/settings/worker`) |
| `app/routeState.ts` | 15 | `workerType` signal write before navigating to `/settings/worker` |
| `app/desktop.ts` | 26 | `useDesktopShell` (shell fork at 1180px) |
| `app/icons.tsx` | 365 | 10 named icons for GeneratePage |
| `lib/ui.tsx` | 125 | `toast`, `Modal`, `Switch`, `ProgressBar`, `ErrorText` |

---

## 3. Dependency Matrix

### 3.1 Generator → host

| Dependency | Nature | Port/Adapter candidate |
|---|---|---|
| `@preact/signals` (signal) | external lib | direct dep of a future package (like web-player) |
| `api/client` (`getJson/postJson/postJsonLong/putJson/sse`) | domain (transport) | **http port** (precedent: `PlayerHttpPort`, `WorkerPorts.api`) |
| `api/models` (generation wire types) | domain (wire contract) | **vendor into package models.ts** (precedent: web-player/models.ts) |
| `positionStore` (`navigateTo`, `position`) | host state | **position port** (precedent: `PlayerPositionPort` write direction) |
| `app/i18n` (`vbookStageLabel`) | UI localization | **i18n port** (typed key union, precedent: `PlayerI18nPort`) |
| `router` (`navigate`) | host navigation | **navigation port** (precedent: `FilePorts.navigation`) |
| `routeState` (`workerType` write) | host route coupling | navigation port payload or routeState adapter |
| `desktop` (`useDesktopShell`) | host shell | **shellMode port** (precedent: `PlayerShellModePort`) |
| `icons` (10 icons) | UI | **icons port** (precedent: `PlayerIconsPort`) |
| `lib/ui` (`toast`, etc.) | UI | **ui port** (precedent: `WorkerPorts.ui`) |
| `resourceInvalidations` (`bookResource`, `onResourceInvalidated`) | host event bus | **invalidations port** (precedent: `PlayerInvalidationsPort`) |
| `resilientReloader` | transport resilience | http port (fold `retryWithBackoff` semantics) |
| `document`/`window` (GeneratePage dialog only) | host DOM | stays in page component / ui port |

### 3.2 Host → Generator (reverse — the blocker cluster)

| Consumer | Symbols consumed | Why it can't move yet |
|---|---|---|
| `app/AppShell.tsx` | `generationStatus`, `bookId`, `phase`, `blankBookJustCreated` | nav pulse class, desktop `/file`+`/navigate` bounce-to-`/play`/`/generate` decision |
| `app/fileAdapters.ts` | `bookId`, `buildId`, `phase`, `errorMessage`, `dirtySummary`, `blankBookJustCreated`, `loadBook`, `emitPlaybackPrepared`, `resetProgressState`, `clearVBookProgress`, `setRegenerating`, `bumpVBookPollToken`, `markImportIncomplete`, `stopGenerationSession` | the FilePorts composition seam — session identity **by reference** |
| `app/playerAdapters.ts` | `bookId`, `buildId`, `onPlaybackPrepared` | `PlayerPorts.session` + `PlayerPorts.generation` |
| `app/navigatorAdapters.ts` | `bookId`, `buildId`, `onPlaybackPrepared` | `NavigatorPorts.bookSource` |
| `pages/EditPage.tsx` | `bookId`, `buildId`, `dirtySummary`, `onPlaybackPrepared` | dirty indicator + generation-completion soft refresh |
| `pages/SettingsPage.tsx` | `bookId`, `resetProgressState` | clear-cache flow |
| `pages/AiAssistantPage.tsx` | `bookId` | book-scoped AI context |
| `main.tsx` | `bookId` | login-triggered `restoreBookSession()` re-entry |
| `state/authStore.ts` | `stashBookSessionForUser`, `restoreStashedBookSessionForUser` | logout/login book-session isolation (**hard auth→identity edge**) |
| `state/fileStore.ts` | no direct import — via injected `SessionSeam`/`GenerationResetSeam`/`PlaybackPreparedSeam`/`PlayerSeam` | `phase`/`errorMessage` dual-writer contract (audit B6) |

Test consumers: `state/__tests__/auth-book-session.test.ts`, `state/fileStore.test.ts`, `app/fileAdapters.test.ts`, both relevant architecture guards.

### 3.3 Generator → existing packages

**None.** Zero `@animastor/*` imports in the contour (grep-verified). The dependency direction is inverted: three extracted packages (web-player, web-editor, web-navigator) consume generator identity/events **through their host adapters**.

### 3.4 Possible cycles

- Historical cycle generateStore⇄playbackStore: **dissolved** — no playbackStore import; guard-pinned (`player-contour.guard.test.ts` forbids `state/generateStore.ts → state/playbackStore.ts` edge). Player release now flows through the fileStore `player` seam.
- Remaining potential cycle if extracted naively: `web-generator ⇄ web-player` via `onPlaybackPrepared` (Generator is the **producer**, Player is the consumer). Extraction must keep the event behind a port (Player already consumes it via `PlayerPorts.generation` — the surviving seam is compatible).

### 3.5 Domain dependency vs Ports/Adapters

| Edge | Classification |
|---|---|
| http transport (client.ts) + wire models | **Ports** (transport seam, like every extracted package) |
| i18n/icons/ui/shellMode/navigation | **Ports** (pure presentation host services) |
| `positionStore.navigateTo` | **Port** (write direction; position is host state) |
| invalidations subscription | **Port** (listen direction) |
| `bookId`/`buildId`/`loadBook`/stash/restore | **NOT portable** — host identity ownership (must stay host-side) |
| `phase`/`errorMessage` | **NOT portable as-is** — dual-writer with fileStore; single source of truth must not fork |
| `onPlaybackPrepared` emission | **Port-able** (emit direction), but consumers (Player/Navigator/Edit) must keep subscribing via adapters — dependency inversion is the risk |
| auth stash/restore | **NOT portable** — authStore→generateStore hard edge; extraction would invert it |

---

## 4. Deep-dive: Can the contour be split?

### 4.1 Pure generation domain logic — YES (DONE, §9)

Extracted into `state/generationProgress/` (Step 1 executed):
- `applyAnalysisEvent` (+ `analysisOverallPercent`, reset via `createInitialAnalysisProgress`) — unit-tested standalone
- `computeProgressRows` + SSE event routing (`routeProgressEvent`)
- Timer math (`GenerationTimerState`, `start/stopGenerationTimer`, `elapsedSeconds`, `formatTimerText`)

~~**Condition:**~~ The module-level Maps (`taskReadyFloor`, `taskCompletedAt`, `taskFrozenElapsed`) and latch gates (`generationCompleted`, `newGenerationPending`, `importCompleteReceived`) are **parameterized into `ProgressTrackingState`** (plus `GenerationTimerState` for the wall-clock lets) — the condition is satisfied.

### 4.2 Domain/service layer first, store host-owned — YES (recommended path)

Split `generateStore.ts`:
- **Host keeps:** identity signals (`bookId`, `buildId`), `loadBook`, persistence + per-user stash/restore, `phase`/`errorMessage` (SessionSeam contract), `onPlaybackPrepared` bus
- **Package gets:** VBook flow (startVBookGeneration, polling, agent-status), progress panel (rows/timers), SSE stream machinery, analysis progress state, layer-config/assets-state fetching, regenerate/cancel actions — all parameterized by a `GenerationSession` handle + ports

Precedent: the fileStore B1 split (seams `GenerationResetSeam`/`PlaybackPreparedSeam`/`PlayerSeam`/`SessionSeam` wired in `app/fileAdapters.ts`).

### 4.3 Split Generator into 2+ package contours — YES, naturally

1. **`generation-progress` (analysis/progress domain):** `applyAnalysisEvent`, `analysisOverallPercent`, `computeProgressRows`, SSE routing, wire models (`ProgressEvent`, `ProgressPanelResponse`, `AgentStatusResponse`, `AnalysisTaskRow`) — **~875 LOC impl + 866 LOC standalone tests, zero identity/auth/playback-write. Step 1 EXECUTED (§9): READY for a mechanical package cut (§10).**
2. **`generation-orchestration` (VBook/bootstrap flow):** start/bootstrap/cancel/poll actions — depends on identity port + http port. Requires the 4.2 split first.
3. **UI (`GeneratePage` + `AnalysisProgressPanel`):** separable from orchestration (imports only signals + ports), but low value until the store split lands.

### 4.4 State/identity duties that MUST stay host-owned

- `bookId`/`buildId` signals + `loadBook` + localStorage persistence (`animastor:currentBook`)
- Per-user stash/restore (`animastor:currentBook:user:<uid>`) + the authStore edge
- `phase`/`errorMessage` (fileStore dual-writer contract, audit B6)
- `onPlaybackPrepared` bus (Player/Navigator/Edit subscribe host-side via adapters)
- `dirtySummary`/`blankBookJustCreated` (file/editor coordination)

### 4.5 UI separate from generation orchestration — YES (mechanically)

`GeneratePage.tsx` imports only signals, ports-able host services (i18n/router/desktop/icons/ui), and analysis panel. It has 4 poll/timer effects (5s worker counts, 1.5s progress panel, 500ms timer tick, 2.5s restore delay) which belong to orchestration — these should move behind a `GenerationController` port if UI is extracted. Desktop/mobile fork stays via shellMode port (web-player precedent).

### 4.6 Event-bus dependencies the package actually needs

Only **one**: `onPlaybackPrepared` (emit direction). Player's subscription already arrives via `PlayerPorts.generation` — no direct coupling. `resourceInvalidations` subscription (listen) for external AI-patch reload in GeneratePage. Both fit a `GeneratorEvents` port group.

## 5. Comparison with extracted packages

| Dimension | web-player (extracted) | web-workers (extracted) | web-local-ai (extracted) | **Generator** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LOC | ~2,000+ | 3,739 | — | 2,553 |
| Own store ownership | no (host playbackStore dissolved into pkg) | yes (self-contained) | yes | **host identity blocker** |
| Session identity (`bookId`/`buildId`) | consumes via ports (by reference) | none | none | **OWNS it** |
| Auth edge | via ports | AuthPort | via ports | **authStore→generateStore hard edge** |
| Consumers | 6 pinned | 1 (SettingsPage) | 2 | **10 direct + seams + 3 packages** |
| Wire contracts vendored | yes (models.ts) | yes | yes | **none exist yet — must vendor** |
| Event bus | consumes `onPlaybackPrepared` | none | none | **produces it** |
| Cycles | resolved (B1 split) | none | none | resolved with player; **new inversion risk if naive** |

**Status NOT READY is confirmed at current HEAD.** The extractions since the last recon (workers, local-ai, editor, ai-chat/settings, orchestration) did not touch the identity/auth/phase cluster — those blockers are structural.

---

## 6. Verdict

**NOT READY** (for full physical extraction of `@animastor/web-generator` as a single unit).  
**READY WITH CONDITIONS** for a domain-first slice (§4.3.1).

### Blockers (exact)

1. **Identity ownership:** `bookId`/`buildId`/`loadBook`/persistence/stash-restore consumed by 10 host files + 3 package adapters; moving them inverts package→host dependency direction.
2. **Auth edge:** `authStore.ts` imports `stashBookSessionForUser`/`restoreStashedBookSessionForUser` — package cannot own logout/login session isolation.
3. **Dual-writer phase/errorMessage:** fileStore SessionSeam + generateStore both write; source of truth must not fork across package boundary.
4. **Event producer inversion:** `onPlaybackPrepared` consumed by Player/Navigator/Edit via adapters — moving the producer inverts the direction unless the bus stays host-side.
5. **No web generation contracts:** wire types live only in host `api/models.ts`; nothing in `@animastor/contracts`.
6. ~~**Module-level state:**~~ **RESOLVED for the progress slice** (§9): timers/Maps/latches now live in explicit state objects (`ProgressTrackingState`/`GenerationTimerState`) owned by the host; still applies to any other slice until split.

### Minimal preparation sequence

1. **Step 1 (safe first contour):** extract generation-progress domain (analysis events, progress rows, SSE routing, timer math) with parameterized state + vendored wire models → package or in-repo module + unit tests moved with it.
2. **Step 2:** split generateStore — identity half stays host (§4.4), orchestration half becomes `GenerationService` parameterized by `GenerationSession` + `GeneratorPorts`.
3. **Step 3:** define `GeneratorPorts` (http+sse, navigateTo, emitPlaybackPrepared, i18n stage labels, invalidations) following `PlayerPorts`/`FilePorts` shape; single `app/generatorAdapters.ts` seam.
4. **Step 4:** add `generator-contour.guard.test.ts` (pinned consumers, entry-only imports, no reverse state deps — same mechanics as the 3 existing guards).
5. **Step 5:** only then, physical extraction of the orchestration+UI package; identity remains host-owned permanently (or until a `@animastor/session` design exists).

---

## 7. Comparison: Generator vs Workflows vs Admin (current HEAD)

| Candidate | LOC | Store | Host coupling | Coupling risk | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Generator** | 2,553 | 1 store, ~30 signals | identity + auth + phase dual-write + event producer | **high** (structural) | **NOT READY** (domain slice: READY WITH CONDITIONS) |
| **Workflows** | ~900 (4 pages: 76+156+508+156) | **no store** (useState/useRef only) | `routeState` signals (`detailsEditMode`, `devConnector`), `titleStore`, api, ui, i18n, router | low | **READY WITH CONDITIONS** |
| **Admin** | 490 (365 page + 125 pure systemAi) | **no store** (authMe subscription) | `authStore` only (needs AuthPort — precedent: web-workers) | low | **READY WITH CONDITIONS** |

Notes:
- **Workflows:** zero generateStore usage, zero bookId/buildId, zero playback coupling; backend-only connector APIs. The two routeState signals are the only cross-page state — manageable via a small ports/navigation contract. Largest LOC win at lowest risk.
- **Admin:** smallest; `features/admin/systemAi.ts` is a pure module (no imports); AdminPage needs an AuthPort (already proven in web-workers). No i18n usage (hardcoded English — internal admin).
- **Generator:** biggest and most valuable long-term, but blocked on identity design.

### Recommendation

**Physically extract `@animastor/web-workflows` next** (biggest safe LOC win, standard Ports/Adapters, no identity coupling). **Admin** as the fast follow (AuthPort precedent exists). **Generator:** start Step 1 now (domain-first slice — analysis/progress logic), full extraction deferred until the identity split (§6, Step 2–3) lands.

---

## 8. Guard pattern reference (for the future extraction)

Follow `frontends/app/src/architecture/*.guard.test.ts` mechanics: raw-source scan via `import.meta.glob(..., { query: '?raw', eager: true })`, `importSpecifiers()` regex extraction; checks: physical structure (old paths gone), entry-only consumption (deep-specifier ban), pinned consumer allowlist, single adapters file building Ports, reverse-dep bans (no state/ module imports the package; no state cycles), identity ownership (no host file binds bookId/buildId from package entry; fileStore must not re-declare identity signals), pinned route mounts in main.tsx, test-mock discipline (entry, not deep paths). A first contour-specific guard already exists: `frontends/app/src/architecture/generation-progress-contour.guard.test.ts` (see §9.4).

---

## 9. Step 1 EXECUTED — generation-progress domain split (in-repo)

**Status:** landed on `c21.4-physically-extract-analysis-from-backend`; no package created; Generator UI behavior unchanged (host public API of `generateStore` preserved 1:1, incl. re-exports of the moved types/fns).

### 9.1 What moved (module: `frontends/app/src/state/generationProgress/`)

| File | LOC (impl/tests) | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `analysis.ts` | 209 / 239 | `AnalysisStatus`/`AnalysisTaskId`/`AnalysisTaskRow`/`AnalysisProgress` types, `createInitialAnalysisProgress` (reset semantics), `applyAnalysisEvent(prev, ev, now?)` (pure; clock injectable), `analysisOverallPercent`, `applyAnalysisHeartbeat` (the SSE `analysis_parallel` branch, pure), `isAnalysisTaskId`, `transition` |
| `vbookProgress.ts` | 112 / 108 | `VBookStage`/`VBookProgress` types, `createIdleVBookProgress`/`createAnalyzingVBookProgress` factories, `vbookProgressFromEvent` (pure SSE `vbook` mapping), `applyAgentStatus(prev, status)` (near-pure `/agent-status` merge, port of `updateVBookProgress`) |
| `progressRows.ts` | 374 / 363 | `TaskRow`/`TaskLabels`/`ProgressPanelState` types, **`ProgressTrackingState`** (explicit object holding the previously module-scope Maps `taskReadyFloor`/`taskCompletedAt`/`taskFrozenElapsed` + latches `generationCompleted`/`newGenerationPending`/`importCompleteReceived`), `createProgressTrackingState`, `resetProgressTracking`, `hasAnyProgress`, `rowTaskKey`, `computeProgressRows(ctx, panel, vbookProg, labels)` |
| `timer.ts` | 51 / 61 | `GenerationTimerState` (explicit object replacing module-scope `timerStartedAt`/`finalElapsedSeconds`), `create/start/stopGenerationTimer`, `elapsedSeconds`, `formatTimerText` |
| `sseRouting.ts` | 60 / 125 | `routeProgressEvent(sink, tracking, data)` — JSON parse + dispatch of `analysis` / `vbook` (+heartbeat) / `generation_complete` (no-op) / `import_complete` (latch). Host signals are written through an explicit `ProgressEventSink` |
| `index.ts` | 69 / — | entry re-exports; documents the boundary rules |

### 9.2 Host side (unchanged ownership, `state/generateStore.ts` 1,323 → 858 LOC)

- `generateStore` now owns exactly: identity (`bookId`/`buildId`, `loadBook`, persistence + per-user stash/restore), `phase`/`errorMessage` (SessionSeam contract, audit B6), `onPlaybackPrepared`/`emitPlaybackPrepared`, nav-icon status machinery, layer-config/assets signals, transport (`api/client`), VBook orchestration actions (`startGeneration`, `startVBookGeneration`, `pollVBookProgress`, `cancel*`, `checkAndRestore*`, `applyGenerationResults`), SSE transport loop (`startProgressStream`/`runProgressStream` — stream machinery, NOT routing).
- It creates the two explicit state objects — `progressTracking: ProgressTrackingState`, `generationTimer: GenerationTimerState` — and passes them into every domain call; the previously hidden module-scope Maps/latches/`let`s are gone from both sides.
- `computeProgressRows` is a thin host wrapper: binds `progressTracking`+`generationTimer`, reads `vbookProgress.value.stage` / `generationStatus.value === 'RUNNING'` at call time, injects `vbookStageLabel` (i18n port-shaped) and the two side-effect ports `onGenerationFinalized` (stop stream + clear COMPLETED stage + SUCCESS + `isRegenerating=false` + `applyGenerationResults`) and `onRunningIdle` (clear RUNNING pulse). The finalize interleaving (domain clears `taskCompletedAt`, host callback does the rest) is synchronous and re-entrancy-free — externally observable write order identical.
- `handleProgressEvent` delegates to `routeProgressEvent` via a module-level `ProgressEventSink` adapter; `importCompleteReceived` now lives on `progressTracking` (read by `pollVBookProgress`, reset by `markImportIncomplete`/`startVBookGeneration`).
- Timer helpers re-exported for pages: `liveElapsedSeconds`, `formatTimerText` (GeneratePage's local duplicates deleted; AnalysisProgressPanel's `formatTimer` duplicate deleted — it imports the store re-export).
- Public surface of `generateStore` preserved: all previously exported symbols still resolve (types via `export type {…}`, `applyAnalysisEvent` re-export, `analysisOverallPercent` wrapper). Consumers (AppShell, fileAdapters, playerAdapters, navigatorAdapters, Edit/Settings/AiAssistant/Generate pages, main.tsx, authStore, fileStore seams, tests) untouched.

### 9.3 Dependencies of the new domain module (guard-pinned)

Allowed imports: domain siblings (`./analysis` etc.) + `../../api/models` **type-only** (wire types — vendored at package-cut time, web-player `models.ts` precedent). Forbidden and verified absent: `api/client`, `app/*` (router/i18n/desktop/icons), host state stores (`positionStore`/`authStore`/`fileStore`/`playbackStore`/`generateStore`), `pages/`, `@animastor/*`, `@preact/signals`. The authStore → generateStore identity edge is unchanged (documented, one-directional). No new cycles: `generateStore → generationProgress` is the only edge and one-directional (state-graph guard re-verified).

### 9.4 Tests

- Moved/extended: `generationProgress/analysis.test.ts` (verbatim migration of the pure suites + new injected-clock + heartbeat cases), `timer.test.ts`, `vbookProgress.test.ts`, `sseRouting.test.ts`, `progressRows.test.ts` (**new**: monotonic floor, stale-done gate incl. tolerance, sibling-row keys, 10s done-window, new-gen gate, all-cancelled guard, RUNNING-pulse self-heal, VBook row states, reset/hasAnyProgress semantics) — all run with **zero** `generateStore` imports (guard-enforced).
- Kept host-side: `generateStore.analysis.test.ts` now covers only the host integration (layer-config roundtrip, SSE seam end-to-end via the domain router, reset wrapper).
- New architecture guard: `architecture/generation-progress-contour.guard.test.ts` (16 assertions: boundary, type-only models, no signals, no module-global state, explicit-state parameterization, host ownership tokens, consumer allowlist, domain-test independence, no premature package).
- Result at time of landing: **typecheck clean, 190/190 tests green, vite build green.**

### 9.5 Deviations / notes

- Two pure functions gained an injectable clock (`applyAnalysisEvent(prev, ev, now = Date.now())`, timer start/stop) — default parameter preserves every production call site; no behavior change.
- One port bug was caught by the new unit tests during the move (agent-status stage id is `create_visual_prompts`, not the SSE's `creating_visuals`) and fixed in the port — final code is a 1:1 port verified by line-diff against HEAD.
- `resetProgressTracking` intentionally does NOT clear `importCompleteReceived` (host `markImportIncomplete` owns it) — matches the previous module-scope behavior exactly.

---

## 10. Re-audit verdict: readiness of `generation-progress` for physical extraction

**READY (mechanical cut).** After Step 1 the §4.3.1 slice requires only packaging work, no further refactoring:

1. **Zero host reach** — imports are domain siblings + `api/models` types only; verified by the new contour guard, which already encodes the package-cut rules (entry-only consumption can be added the day the package exists).
2. **No hidden state** — blocker 6 (module-level Maps/latches) is resolved: all mutable state arrives as explicit objects the host owns; the domain is pure/near-pure and clock-injectable.
3. **Tests travel** — 5 domain test files (866 LOC) import nothing but the domain; they move with the package unchanged.
4. **What must be vendored at cut time** (mechanical, precedent-backed): the `ProgressEvent`, `ProgressPanelResponse`, `ProgressTask` (and a slice of `AgentStatusResponse` shape, already narrowed as `AgentStatusLike`) wire types — into a package `models.ts`, like web-player.
5. **What stays host-side permanently** (unchanged): identity (`bookId`/`buildId`/`loadBook`/stash/restore), `phase`/`errorMessage` (B6 dual-writer contract), `onPlaybackPrepared` bus, SSE/HTTP transport (`api/client`), VBook orchestration actions, `vbookStageLabel` i18n injection (port-shaped already), and the signal binding (the domain is signal-free; the future package gets its own signals or keeps the sink/ctx pattern).
6. **Remaining seams to define at cut time** (small): the host wrapper's ctx callbacks (`setRegenerating`, `onGenerationFinalized`, `onRunningIdle`, `vbookStageLabel`) become a `ProgressHostPorts` object — the current `ProgressRowContext` + `ProgressEventSink` shapes are already port-shaped, so this is renaming, not redesign.

The overall `@animastor/web-generator` verdict stays **NOT READY** (identity/auth/phase blockers per §6 — Step 2/3 unchanged). The §6 blocker list shrinks by one: blocker 6 (module-level state) is now resolved for the progress slice.

*Step-1 change executed and documented on this branch; no packages created, no files moved out of the host app.*
